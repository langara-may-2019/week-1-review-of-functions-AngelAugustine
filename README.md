# Coffee Break Code - JQuery

Welcome! This is the first week of the coffee break code experiment, so if there is any feedback or things that you would like to change, please let me know! I want this to be the best practical resource of practising your coding skills.

## Week 1 - Review of Functions

### A Quick Note About Days 1 - 3:

This is a quick review of functions, before we dive into jQuery itself. jQuery is based on callback functions, so the slides are a review of that material. If you are a pro at functions, feel free to skip ahead. There are 3 questions in the javascript file, so do one a day, but if you're on a roll, by all means do more than one. This is not meant to take a lot of time away from your regular school work, so if you are falling behind on these challenges, that is fine. Just jump back in when you can. 

# Have Fun and Happy Coding!
